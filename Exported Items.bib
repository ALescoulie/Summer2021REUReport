	abstract = {The multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio is provably the lowest variance unbiased estimator of both free energies and ensemble averages, and has a number of important advantages over previous methods, such as WHAM. Despite its advantages, the original MBAR paper was rather dense and mathematically complicated, limiting the extent to which people could expand and apply it. We present here a different way to think about MBAR that is much more intuitive and makes it clearer why the method works so well.},

	abstract = {Alchemical free energy calculations are a useful tool for predicting free energy differences associated with the transfer of molecules from one environment to another. The hallmark of these methods is the use of "bridging" potential energy functions representing \_alchemical\_ intermediate states that cannot exist as real chemical species. The data collected from these bridging alchemical thermodynamic states allows the efficient computation of transfer free energies (or differences in transfer free energies) with orders of magnitude less simulation time than simulating the transfer process directly. While these methods are highly flexible, care must be taken in avoiding common pitfalls to ensure that computed free energy differences can be robust and reproducible for the chosen force field, and that appropriate corrections are included to permit direct comparison with experimental data. In this paper, we review current best practices for several popular application domains of alchemical free energy calculations, including relative and absolute small molecule binding free energy calculations to biomolecular targets.},

	abstract = {As access to computational resources continues to increase, free-energy calculations have emerged as a powerful tool that can play a predictive role in a wide range of research areas. Yet, the reliability of these calculations can often be improved significantly if a number of precepts, or good practices, are followed. Although the theory upon which these good practices rely has largely been known for many years, it is often overlooked or simply ignored. In other cases, the theoretical developments are too recent for their potential to be fully grasped and merged into popular platforms for the computation of free-energy differences. In this contribution, the current best practices for carrying out free-energy calculations using free energy perturbation and nonequilibrium work methods are discussed, demonstrating that at little to no additional cost, free-energy estimates could be markedly improved and bounded by meaningful error estimates. Monitoring the probability distributions that underlie the transformation between the states of interest, performing the calculation bidirectionally, stratifying the reaction pathway, and choosing the most appropriate paradigms and algorithms for transforming between states offer significant gains in both accuracy and precision.},

	abstract = {MDAnalysis (http://mdanalysis.org) is a library for structural and temporal analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories and individual protein structures. MD simulations of biological molecules have become an important tool to elucidate the relationship between molecular structure and physiological function. Simulations are performed with highly optimized software packages on HPC resources but most codes generate output trajectories in their own formats so that the development of new trajectory analysis algorithms is conﬁned to speciﬁc user communities and widespread adoption and further development is delayed. MDAnalysis addresses this problem by abstracting access to the raw simulation data and presenting a uniform object-oriented Python interface to the user. It thus enables users to rapidly write code that is portable and immediately usable in virtually all biomolecular simulation communities. The user interface and modular design work equally well in complex scripted work ﬂows, as foundations for other packages, and for interactive and rapid prototyping work in IPython / Jupyter notebooks, especially together with molecular visualization provided by nglview and time series analysis with pandas. MDAnalysis is written in Python and Cython and uses NumPy arrays for easy interoperability with the wider scientiﬁc Python ecosystem. It is widely used and forms the foundation for more specialized biomolecular simulation tools. MDAnalysis is available under the GNU General Public License v2.},

Performing MD simulations requires a user to become familiar with the commands, options, and ﬁle formats of the chosen simulation software, none of which are consistent across diﬀerent programs. Beyond these requirements, users are expected to be familiar with various aspects of physics, mathematics, computer programming, and interaction with a command-line environment, presenting critical barriers to entry in the MD simulation ﬁeld. This article presents seven tutorials for instructing users in the proper methods for preparing and carrying out diﬀerent types of MD simulations in the popular GROMACS simulation package. GROMACS is an open-source, free, and ﬂexible MD package that is consistently among the fastest in the world. The tutorials presented here range from a "simple" system of a protein in aqueous solution to more advanced concepts such as force ﬁeld organization and modiﬁcation for a membrane-protein system, two methods of calculating free energy diﬀerences (umbrella sampling and "alchemical" methods), biphasic systems, protein-ligand complexes, and the use of virtual sites in MD simulations. In this article, users are provided the rationale and a theoretical explanation for the command-line syntax in each step in the online tutorials (available at http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx) and the underlying settings and algorithms necessary to perform robust MD simulations in each scenario.},
