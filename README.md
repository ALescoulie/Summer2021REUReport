# Technical Report: SPIDAL Summer REU 2021 Upgrading MDPOW and Adding Analysis Functionality

Summer of 2021 I did an REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) in the [Beckstein Lab](https://becksteinlab.physics.asu.edu) at the Center for Biological Physics at Arizona State University. This report was written to document my work over the program specifically on updating the python package [MDPOW](https://github.com/Becksteinlab/MDPOW).
